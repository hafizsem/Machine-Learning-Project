# Machine Learning Project: Interbank-Intra Bank Analysis

## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1 Description

Welcome to the Machine Learning Project for the "Interbank-Intra Bank" analysis, a part of the Sem 5 Data Analytics course. In this project, we will be creating a machine learning model to analyze and predict trends related to interbank and intra-bank transactions. The data used for this project is sourced from Bank Negara Malaysia.

## 2. Objectives

### 2.1 Project Objectives

- **Machine Learning Model:**
  - Develop a machine learning model to predict trends in interbank and intra-bank transactions.
  - Evaluate the model's performance and accuracy.

- **Data Visualization:**
  - Visualize data to identify patterns, correlations, and insights.
  - Create informative visualizations to present trends and key findings.

### 2.2 Data Description

The dataset obtained from Bank Negara Malaysia contains information about interbank and intra-bank transactions. Key features include transaction amounts, dates, transaction types, and relevant details.

## 3. Project Components

### 3.1 Machine Learning Model

- **Algorithm Selection:**
  - Choose an appropriate machine learning algorithm for predicting trends in interbank and intra-bank transactions.
